## 4\. Theory

The AT89C51 is an 8-bit microcontroller belonging to the 8051 family. It is widely used in embedded systems for controlling electronic devices and performing automation tasks.

It consists of an 8-bit CPU, 4 KB of Flash program memory, 128 bytes of RAM, 32 programmable input/output pins, two 16-bit timers/counters, a serial communication port, and interrupt control circuitry.

In this project, the AT89C51 microcontroller is used to control a buzzer and speaker based on the input received from a push button.

The push button is connected to Port 1, pin P1.2. A 10 kΩ pull-down resistor is connected between the input pin and ground to maintain a stable LOW logic level when the button is not pressed.

When the push button is pressed, a HIGH logic signal is applied to P1.2. The microcontroller detects this signal and generates a HIGH output at P3.2.

The output signal is applied to the base of a BC547 NPN transistor through a 330 Ω resistor. The transistor acts as an electronic switch and controls the current flowing through the buzzer.

When the transistor switches ON, current flows through the buzzer and produces an audible sound. When the button is released, the transistor switches OFF and the sound stops.

Thus, this project demonstrates digital input interfacing, transistor switching, and output-device control using the AT89C51 microcontroller.

## 5\. Description of Components

### 5.1 AT89C51 Microcontroller

The AT89C51 is an 8-bit microcontroller used in embedded control applications.

**Features:**

- 8-bit CPU.
- 4 KB Flash memory.
- 128 bytes internal RAM.
- 32 programmable I/O pins.
- Two 16-bit timers/counters.
- Serial communication interface.
- Five interrupt sources.

**Applications in this project:**

- P1.2 receives the push-button input.
- P3.2 controls the transistor driver.
- VCC and GND provide the required power supply.

### 5.2 Push Button

A push button is a mechanical switching device used to establish or interrupt an electrical connection.

A normally open push button remains open when released and closes when pressed.

- Released condition: LOW logic.
- Pressed condition: HIGH logic.

### 5.3 Buzzer

A buzzer is an electronic sound-producing device that converts electrical energy into sound energy.

A 5V active buzzer contains an internal oscillator and produces sound when DC power is supplied.

### 5.4 Speaker

A speaker converts electrical audio signals into sound waves through the movement of its diaphragm.

A passive speaker requires an alternating audio signal to produce continuous sound. A suitable audio driver is required for proper speaker operation.

### 5.5 BC547 Transistor

The BC547 is a general-purpose NPN bipolar junction transistor.

It consists of three terminals:

- Base (B)
- Collector (C)
- Emitter (E)

The transistor operates as an electronic switch. When sufficient base current is supplied, it allows current to flow from collector to emitter.

### 5.6 Resistors

Resistors are used to limit current and maintain stable voltage levels.

- 330 Ω resistor: Limits transistor base current.
- 10 kΩ resistor: Maintains LOW input when the push button is released.
- 10 kΩ reset resistor: Forms part of the reset circuit.

### 5.7 Capacitor

A 0.1 µF capacitor is used for supply decoupling or as part of the reset circuit, depending on the circuit arrangement.

- The emitter is connected to ground.
- The collector is connected to the negative terminal of the buzzer.
- The positive terminal of the buzzer is connected to +5V.

**Note:** Use a suitable audio driver for a passive speaker. Check transistor current ratings before connecting multiple loads. Use a flyback diode across a magnetic buzzer where required.

## 7\. Working Principle

The system works on the principle of digital switching and transistor operation.

1. Initially, the push button is in the released condition.
2. The 10 kΩ pull-down resistor maintains P1.2 at LOW logic level.
3. The microcontroller continuously monitors the input pin.
4. When the button is pressed, +5V is applied to P1.2.
5. The input changes from LOW to HIGH.
6. The microcontroller detects the HIGH signal.
7. P3.2 becomes HIGH.
8. Base current flows into the BC547 transistor through the base resistor.
9. The transistor switches ON and activates the buzzer.
10. When the button is released, P1.2 becomes LOW.
11. P3.2 becomes LOW and the transistor switches OFF.
12. The buzzer stops producing sound.

## 8\. Algorithm

```c
#include <reg51.h>

sbit BUTTON = P1^2;
sbit BUZZER = P3^2;

void delay_ms(unsigned int ms)
{
    unsigned int i, j;

    for(i = 0; i < ms; i++)
    {
        for(j = 0; j < 112; j++)
        {
            /* Approximate delay */
        }
    }
}

void main(void)
{
    BUTTON = 1;
    BUZZER = 0;

    while(1)
    {
        if(BUTTON == 1)
        {
            delay_ms(20);

            if(BUTTON == 1)
            {
                BUZZER = 1;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            BUZZER = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

## 11\. Program Explanation

- `#include <reg51.h>` includes the 8051 register definitions.
- `BUTTON = P1^2` assigns P1.2 as the input pin.
- `BUZZER = P3^2` assigns P3.2 as the output pin.
- `delay_ms()` generates an approximate software delay.
- `BUTTON = 1` releases the port pin for input operation.
- `BUZZER = 0` initially switches OFF the output.
- `while(1)` continuously executes the program.
- `if(BUTTON == 1)` checks whether the push button is pressed.
- `delay_ms(20)` reduces false triggering caused by switch bouncing.
- `BUZZER = 1` activates the transistor driver.
- `BUZZER = 0` deactivates the transistor driver.

## 12\. Design Calculations

### 12.1 Power Supply Calculation

Given:

- Supply voltage = 5V
- Assumed microcontroller current = 20 mA

Power consumption:

P = V × I

P = 5 × 0.02

P = 0.1 W

Therefore, the estimated microcontroller power consumption is:

**P = 100 mW**
**output**
<img width="1600" height="951" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b273ff3-b023-4a6d-aa85-4fbc9ae7dbee" />
<img width="1600" height="961" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c6e06b6-3b97-4b37-849d-0942a80128a6" />



### 12.2 Pull-Down Resistor Calculation

Given:

- Supply voltage = 5V
- Pull-down resistance = 10 kΩ

Using Ohm's law:

I = V/R

I = 5/10000

I = 0.0005 A

I = 0.5 mA

Therefore, the pull-down resistor current when the button is pressed is:

**I = 0.5 mA**

### 12.3 Transistor Base Resistor Calculation

Given:

- Output voltage (nominal assumption) = 5V
- Base-emitter voltage = 0.7V
- Base resistor = 330 Ω

Base current:

Ib = (Vout - Vbe)/Rb

Ib = (5 - 0.7)/330

Ib = 4.3/330

Ib = 0.013 A

Ib = 13.03 mA

Therefore, the nominal calculated base current is approximately:

**Ib = 13.03 mA**

The actual base current depends on the AT89C51 output voltage under load. Verify the microcontroller's guaranteed output-current specifications before using this resistor value.

### 12.4 Buzzer Power Calculation

Assume:

- Buzzer voltage = 5V
- Buzzer current = 30 mA

Power:

P = V × I

P = 5 × 0.03

P = 0.15 W

Therefore:

**Buzzer power = 150 mW**

This is an illustrative calculation. Actual current depends on the selected buzzer.

### 12.5 Transistor Collector Current

Assume:

- Collector current = 30 mA
- Base current for illustrative design = 3 mA

Forced current gain:

Beta = Ic/Ib

Beta = 30/3

Beta = 10

Therefore:

**Forced current gain = 10**

The base current and resistor must be selected according to the transistor datasheet and microcontroller output-current limits.

### 12.6 Debouncing Delay Calculation

The software uses a delay of 20 milliseconds to reduce mechanical switch bouncing.

Given:

Delay = 20 ms

Converting into seconds:

20/1000 = 0.02 seconds

Therefore:

**Debouncing delay = 0.02 seconds**

### 12.7 Total Power Calculation

Assume:

- Microcontroller current = 20 mA
- Buzzer current = 30 mA

Total current:

Itotal = 20 + 30

Itotal = 50 mA

Total power:

Ptotal = V × I

Ptotal = 5 × 0.05

Ptotal = 0.25 W

Therefore:

**Estimated total power = 250 mW**

These are theoretical example values, not measured experimental readings.

## 15\. Expected Output

| Push Button Status | P1.2 Input | P3.2 Output | Buzzer | Speaker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Released | LOW | LOW | OFF | OFF |

_Speaker operation requires a suitable audio-frequency driver when using a passive speaker._

## 16\. Result Analysis

The experimental operation demonstrates that the AT89C51 can detect digital input signals and control external devices through its output pins.

When the push button is pressed, P1.2 receives a HIGH logic signal. The microcontroller generates a HIGH output at P3.2, activating the BC547 transistor driver.
